  # Description
  When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the  application. This project command line application automatically generates a professional readme file for the repository based on the user's answers. When the application runs, it presents a series of questions in the terminal whose answers fill the sections in the readme.
